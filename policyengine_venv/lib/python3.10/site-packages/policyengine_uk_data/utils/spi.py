# This script generates SPI-based statistics on income types from public SPI publications.
# There are two tables needed:
# Profit, employment and pension income: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/earned-income-2010-to-2011
# Property, interest and dividend income: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/investment-income-2010-to-2011
# Minor step to avoid an ods dependency: put the ODS files into a CSV file with the header being the table header, then point the below references to those CSVs.

# Python script to extract income statistics from SPI .ods files.
